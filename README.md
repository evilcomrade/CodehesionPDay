# CodehesionPDay
Codehesion Project Day - Author Book Api

So i ran into a few issues i wasnt able to solve, not all of the queries execute on the actual DB, and the ony query i was testing with since i was 
running out of time was Book, which takes a reference, which i did not know how to pass through Postman (was only sending strings or ints) so i was unable
to verify wether or not it was reflecting appropriately.

Final Part: (source code also included but just in case this is easier for you:)
